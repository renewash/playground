# Commit Types Cheatsheet

### `feat` – New Feature or Functionality

`feat` is used for adding new features or functionality.

#### When to Use

- Adding a brand-new feature
- Implementing new functionality that wasn’t there before
- Introducing a new behavior (e.g., a new UI component)
- Adding a new configuration option or parameter to an existing system

#### Examples

- `feat: provide google sheets adapter`
- `feat(ui): add dark mode to the user interface`
- `feat(api): add support for pagination in user endpoint`

### `fix` – Fix a Bug

`fix` is used to address actual bugs that cause incorrect behavior in production code.

#### When to Use

- Correcting unintentional or erroneous behavior
- Fixing a known bug
- Correcting invalid or malfunctioning visual styles (e.g., fixing incorrect color values)
- Resolving crashes or runtime errors

#### Examples

- `fix: correct CSS color for button background`
- `fix: null pointer handling`
- `fix(frontend): remove flickering effect on page refresh`

### `perf` – Performance Improvements

`perf` is used for changes that bring measurable performance improvements.

#### When to Use

- Optimizing existing code for speed or memory usage
- Reducing overhead in database queries or API calls
- Improving rendering or load times
- Adding caching mechanisms to frequently accessed data

#### Examples

- `perf: reduce number of redundant API calls`
- `perf(ui): improve table rendering performance`
- `perf: add caching for user session data`

### `refactor` – Code Refactoring without Changing Behavior

`refactor` is for structural improvements to the code without changing its behavior. Unlike `style`, `refactor` focuses on enhancing the internal structure, logic, or organization of the code without altering its external behavior.

#### When to Use

- Restructuring or reorganizing code for clarity, maintainability, or scalability
- Extracting common logic into utility functions
- Splitting large modules into smaller, more focused ones
- Making a code section fail-safe without changing functionality
- Adding `Optional` to handle potential null values gracefully
- Simplifying complex conditions or loops
- Adding a `@Nullable` annotation to indicate that a value can be null, helping static analysis tools warn developers and reduce the risk of `NullPointerExceptions`.
- Renaming variables or methods for readability and clarity

#### Examples

- `refactor: extract utility functions for data validation`
- `refactor(ui): separate styling logic from component logic`
- `refactor: use Optional to handle potential null values in data processing`
- `refactor: simplify nested loops`
- `refactor: rename variable temp to temperature`

### `style` – Code Formatting and Style-Only Changes

`style` is for cosmetic changes to code that do not affect its behavior. Key Difference from `refactor`: `style` changes are purely superficial and do not affect the structure, semantics, or functionality of the code.

#### When to Use

- Formatting the codebase (e.g., via Prettier, ESLint)
- Adjusting whitespace, indentation, line breaks, or punctuation
- Making purely cosmetic changes that do **not** affect behavior

#### Examples

- `style: reformat code with ESLint rules`
- `style: change indentation from 2 to 4 spaces`
- `style: fix formatting inconsistencies across multiple files`

### `test` – Tests and Test-Related Changes

`test` is used for adding, modifying, fixing or improving tests.

#### When to Use

- Adding or updating unit, integration, or end-to-end tests
- Refactoring test code or changing test data
- Fixing broken test scripts
- Adding quality assurance scripts
- Covering edge cases in existing tests

#### Examples

- `test: add integration tests for checkout process`
- `test(auth): improve token validation tests`
- `test: add load testing script for performance checks`
- `test: cover edge cases for user registration validation`

### `docs` – Documentation

`docs` is used for changes to documentation, comments, or API descriptions.

#### When to Use

- Making changes to documentation files (e.g., `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`)
- Adding or updating inline code comments, docstrings, or usage guides
- Writing API documentation
- Updating setup instructions

#### Examples

- `docs: update README to include installation steps`
- `docs: add comments to public methods`
- `docs: document API usage examples for new endpoints`

### `build` – Build Process or Dependencies

`build` should be used for changes that impact the build process or production dependencies, including tools and configurations necessary for application deployment or runtime.

#### When to Use

- Updating build scripts (Webpack, Rollup, etc.)
- Changing or upgrading dependencies (npm, Maven, Gradle, etc.) that affect production code
- Modifying how the application is bundled or deployed
- Adjusting Docker or Kubernetes configurations

#### Examples

- `build: upgrade webpack to version 5`
- `build(deps): update express to v4.18.1` ← (Dependency for production code)
- `build: update Dockerfile for multi-stage builds`

### `ci` – Continuous Integration

`ci` is used for changes to CI/CD configurations or workflows.

#### When to Use

- Changing CI/CD configuration files or scripts
- Updating workflows for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.
- Adding new CI steps (e.g., code coverage, automated security scans)

#### Examples

- `ci: add code quality checks in GitHub Actions`
- `ci: configure Jenkins pipeline for integration tests`
- `ci: add security scan step in GitLab pipeline`

### `chore` – Maintenance and Routine Tasks

`chore` is used for administrative or supportive tasks that do not impact production code.

#### When to Use

- Miscellaneous tasks or project administration that doesn’t fit other types
- Updating `.gitignore`, adjusting package scripts, or other project settings
- Renaming or moving files/folders without changing actual code logic
- Adjusting or creating scripts that help with local/manual testing or make development easier
- Adding `@SuppressWarnings` annotations to resolve build or IDE warnings
- Updating development dependencies (e.g., `eslint`, `jest`)

#### Examples

- `chore: update .gitignore to exclude .idea files`
- `chore: reorganize folder structure for better clarity`
- `chore: adjust local test script for manual QA`
- `chore: suppress unchecked cast warnings in legacy code`
- `chore(deps): update eslint to v8.14.0`

### `revert` – Revert a Previous Commit

`revert` is used to roll back a previous commit.

#### When to Use

- Undoing or rolling back a previous commit when necessary
- Typically references the commit hash that is being reverted

#### Examples

- `revert: "feat: add social login feature"`
- `revert: "fix: correct CSS color for button background"`
